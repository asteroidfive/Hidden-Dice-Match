This is a casino game where your objective is to match your dice roll with a hidden dice roll. You start off with $100 and place your bet from there. If your total matches the hidden total, the bet amount is added to your total money. If both dice match the hidden dice, your total is multiplied by ten. If one of youre die matches one of the hidden die, half if your bet amount will be added to your total. If you match nothing, your bet will be deducted. If you reach $0, the game will end.
